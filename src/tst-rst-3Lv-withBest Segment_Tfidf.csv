In the case of the unified standard development, the original outcomes outlined in the Responsible Animal Fiber (RAF) Framework Theory of Change still hold true. The RAF standards were designed to recognize and reward farmers who meet good practice requirements for animal welfare, land management, and social areas. Certification to the standards allows market access to international buyers who have expectations for raw material production across the key topics listed above. In addition to independent evaluation of conformance-based criteria required for certification, MEL indicators in the unified standard are designed to monitor interventions related to the"
