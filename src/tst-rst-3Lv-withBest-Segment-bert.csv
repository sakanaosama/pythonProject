In a broader context than standards, this information will provide insight into support and capacity-building activities. Recognition The unified standard scope includes proposed raw materials that we have not previously covered at the tier 4 production level in our current standards. When we look at new raw materials, our goal is to first consider opportunities for developing recognition partnerships. Recognition in the unified standard represents forming a partnership to collaborate on standard systems in an effort to combine forces, reduce redundancy, and work towards positive impacts faster, and together. A key reason for a partnership-first approach is to leverage sustainability standards and certification as a tool that incentivizes practices on the ground that drive outcomes in a desired direction. Alternatively, adding to the proliferation of standards, audits, and certificates in the marketplace is counter to driving impacts. We are looking at a wide range of raw materials as well as impact areas (e.g., human rights & livelihoods) to recognize verification systems, meaning the recognition framework will include different models. The recognition model will depend on the material and the peer organization as an effort to be adaptable to meet different needs based on areas of alignment and opportunities for growth. Cashmere is a candidate raw material for recognition. We consider cashmere to be a strategic fiber to include in our future standard system in alignment with our Climate+ goal, but we also acknowledge there are peer organizations that have already developed expertise and invested in standards for this space. The recognition model for cashmere is not yet defined, but options in the draft framework include: Growth partnerships: a partnership model is formed between our organizations to collaborate on growth areas committed to the Climate+ goal and targets; Specified recognition: verification evidence from recognized systems is accepted for the specified impact criteria in place of the applicable criteria being evaluated for the unified standard; Full recognition: materials from recognized standards are eligible to enter the unified standard system at certified sites. In all models, recognition partnerships include a commitment to shared measurement of impact areas, participation in aligned standard system tools (e.g., Trackit), and an opportunity to create a unified platform across standard users and brands to engage with.

We call this Climate+. The unified standard aims to meaningfully embed the Climate+ goal into the raw material scope for all materials included in our certification. An additional objective is to harmonize systems across the full scope of our current standards and to create stronger communication at the consumerfacing level. We are releasing content of the standard in stages. For the first draft consultation, most of the standard criteria in the areas of organizational management, human rights, land use, animal welfare, and processing facilities were available for comment. Each criterion was tagged as a conformance-related criterion (binding for certification) or leadership criterion (non-binding for certification, but just a recommendation). For public consultation on the second draft, we are releasing the revised content from the first draft based on feedback received. Additionally, new draft content is included, covering criteria for group certification, chain of custody, claims and logo use, and slaughterhouses, as well as monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) indicators. The main impact areas of the unified standard system focus on Tier 4 raw material management (including the cultivation and extraction of raw materials from the earth, plants, or animals), and “Tier 3.5” first processing (including processes such as ginning, retting, degumming, cottonizing, wool scouring, dissolving pulp, and chemical/mechanical recycling). To provide highlights on key material categories included in the future standard system, we have developed a series of summary papers to supplement the draft standard criteria.

Group Certification Group Certification requirements are the same as they are for RAF and are summarized below. Group Certification is a mechanism under which groups of farmers can be managed and audited as a collective. Each group is managed by a legal entity, which is the certified organization. This organization puts in place an Internal Control System (ICS) to manage and carry out annual UNIFIED STANDARD SYSTEM DRAFT 2 10 internal inspections of all its group members. Annual third-party auditing of the ICS and a sampling of group members is conducted according to a risk assessment protocol and the overall size of the group. The Group Certification approach allows for improved efficiency in meeting and auditing standard requirements. The most common form of Group Certification is the Farm Group model, where all members of a group must comply with all applicable standard requirements and maintain all records and plans in the same way as farmers that are individually certified. There are no constraints on size or type of farming operation, but group members are either all in the same country or all in the EU. An additional Group Certification option exists, but only for farmers who meet criteria relating to economic and technical constraints. This is known as Communal Farmer Group certification. As with the Farm Group model all standard criteria are applicable to all members, but the expectation for records, plans and audit practices is different. For Communal Farmer Groups, plans and records that are representative of all members are created by the ICS at the group level rather than at the individual farmer level, and during audits more emphasis is placed on animal welfare outcomes as a measure of whether good practices are in place. Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) Indicators Through our Climate+ strategy, we have set out to guide the global textile industry towards achieving a 45% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions within raw materials production by 2030. To get there, our focus is holistic and interconnected with accelerating the adoption of practices that improve the state of our water, soil health, and biodiversity. To facilitate this, Textile Exchange’s organization-wide Impact Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) Framework is being built to include indicators linked to our Climate+ goal to monitor the implementation and performance of interventions to ensure their effectiveness as well as assess their scale and reach.

Certification to the standards allows market access to international buyers who have expectations for raw material production across the key topics listed above. In addition to independent evaluation of conformance-based criteria required for certification, MEL indicators in the unified standard are designed to monitor interventions related to the impact that the standard is working towards. In this regard, MEL indicators are collected as part of auditing and certification to the standard to tell whether the implementation of practices are moving in the direction of desired outcomes. At the program-wide scale (e.g., where data is collected from all certified sites/certified organizations), MEL indicators within the standard could include metrics like the amount of land under certification, the extent of implementation of certain practices, and possible reductions in chemical use over time. Data contributing to unified standard MEL indicators will largely be captured through the use of the Farm Questionnaire which is currently being updated from RAF to include other raw materials in the standard scope. The Farm Questionnaire is also being re-assessed for the questions/data requested in terms of relevance and detail to the Climate+ direction in the new standard system. For Draft 2, a criterion is included requiring that the Farm Questionnaire be completed by the organization as part of the audit process. Standard criteria that relate to verification of information collected in the farm questionnaire are tagged as “MEL Indicator.” Additional criteria that include a measurement component and can be UNIFIED STANDARD SYSTEM DRAFT 2 11 used to monitor the effectiveness of the standard over time are also tagged as MEL indicators. In both cases, this does not mean new criteria have been added, but rather that “MEL Indicator” provides visibility on information as part of the standard that may be used in monitoring and evaluation. Broader system information to connect different monitoring areas could include the number of certified sites, volume of certified material, market share of certified materials, and nonconformities issued, for example. As part of the MEL Framework, the unified standard will also feature monitoring on a voluntary basis of a smaller representative sample of certified sites to collect more detailed metrics. The purpose of these detailed assessments is to track the progress of the standard in relation to delivering the intended impacts as well as to gain a deeper understanding of the production context to inform future standard developments. In a broader context than standards, this information will provide insight into support and capacity-building activities.

When we look at new raw materials, our goal is to first consider","their scale and reach. In the case of the unified standard development, the original outcomes outlined in the Responsible Animal Fiber (RAF) Framework Theory of Change still hold true. The RAF standards were designed to recognize and reward farmers who meet good practice requirements for animal welfare, land management, and social areas. Certification to the standards allows market access to international buyers who have expectations for raw material production across the key topics listed above. In addition to independent evaluation of conformance-based criteria required for certification, MEL indicators in the unified standard are designed to monitor interventions related to the impact that the standard is working towards. In this regard, MEL indicators are collected as part of auditing and certification to the standard to tell whether the implementation of practices are moving in the direction of desired outcomes.

These materials are: • Animal Derived: Cashmere • Biomaterials: Biosynthetics • Forest Derived: MMCF • Fiber Crops: Cotton UNIFIED STANDARD SYSTEM DRAFT 2 2 Background We have two overarching objectives for the unified standard. The first connects to the number of certified sites participating across the eight standards that we currently offer. With this transition, we have the opportunity to provide efficiency by bringing all materials in the scope of these standards under one harmonized system. The second objective is to embed our Climate+ goal and drive impact and outcomes through participation in standards and certification. Currently, each material-specific standard (GRS, RCS, RWS, RMS, RAS, and RDS)1 was developed separately and operates uniquely in terms of structure and reach. Each standard also incorporates its unique focus areas. While standards like the RWS, RMS, and RAS all contain land management and social criteria, the RDS does not include those attributes. In contrast, the journey towards unifying this system has focused on exploring where it is relevant and meaningful to incorporate Climate+ and other key impact areas, addressing how the material is managed on the ground as well as the first stage of production. This shift in scope represents our standard for raw material certification. Certified materials will be tracked through the supply chain with our pre-existing chain of custody standard: the Content Claim Standard (CCS). While the CCS continues to provide the mechanism for tracking and handling of the certified inputs through to the finished product, the unified standard impact criteria are being developed for Tiers 4 and 3.5 of the supply chain. Timeline Similar to the process of moving from the first to the second drafts of the standard, stakeholders’ feedback from the second consultation will be considered in changes made as we move to approve a final version of the standard at the end of 2023. The final version is planned for publication in early 2024 to be used for pilot testing and implementation planning. Throughout the year 2024, we will conduct a full internal systems update to align with the new standard, as well as provide the necessary implementation planning for all stakeholders in the system (e.g., taking adequate time to align across our assurance system, the accreditation and certification bodies’ systems, and for sites to prepare their operations to get certified). We will also update pre-existing documents to reflect the harmonized standards system. Our current timeline has the standard becoming effective in 2025. During 2025, sites may request certification to the unified standard, but this will still be optional as this year is transitional for sites already certified to any of the previous standards (i.e., Global Recycled Standard – GRS, Recycled Claim Standard – RCS, Responsible Wool Standard – RWS, Responsible Mohair Standard – RMS, Responsible Alpaca","skins • Recycled: synthetic and natural materials Consequently, some of the materials proposed for inclusion within the scope of the unified standard will be added through the recognition of external standards rather than through direct Textile Exchange raw material certification.
