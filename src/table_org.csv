3) It is understood that it is important for alpacas' welfare that the fleece is removed each year. Any animal that has to be released before shearing is complete should be returned to its companions and allow it time to settle before a further attempt to complete shearing is made.

However, the intent of this criterion is that the organization works to minimize the need to routinely mix different groups of animals, and as far as possible allows established social order to be maintained.

2) For down production, mixing may occur if young birds are initially kept in multiple brooder circles and then all released into the main house. This is not a risky time for aggression. Mixing of older birds should not be done.",Conformance-Related,Minor,"Sheep wool, Mohair, Alpaca, Down, Skins",

The most common are livestock guardian dogs, but donkeys and llamas have also been used.

2) The success of guardian animals will depend on the type and number of predators, the size of the herd or flock, and the number of guardians bonded to that flock.

3) For example, llamas have been shown to chase small predators such as foxes away from the flock, but if the main threat is jackal or coyote, guardian dogs will be more appropriate. With a large flock and/or multiple potential predator attacks, multiple guardian animals will be needed.

2) Planning the birthing period also requires planning which animals are bred and when. If young females are bred too early, there may be a higher risk of mortality for them and their offspring due to multiple factors, including: young females producing lower birth weight offspring; complications at birthing from young females that are not big enough to give birth without assistance; and poorer maternal instinct from young females.
